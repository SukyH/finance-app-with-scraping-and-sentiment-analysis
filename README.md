Finance App (Capstone project)
Overview

The Finance App is a web-based application designed to enhance financial literacy through interactive workshops, real-world simulations, and dynamic content. Targeted primarily at high school students (or potentially university students), this application allows users to earn points by completing various financial literacy actions. The project integrates sentiment analysis to assess the tone of financial news articles and uses web scraping to fetch real-time financial news and trends. The application uses cutting-edge technologies such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and Firebase to provide a seamless experience.

    User Registration & Authentication: Secure login and account management with Firebase.
    Feedback submission
    Admin Dashboard: Manage users, view feedback, and oversee school partnerships and volunteers.
    Volunteer and School Partner sign-ups
    Financial education content
    Sentiment Analysis : Analyze user feedback to improve content and engagement.
    Web Scraping : Extract real-time financial news and trends to provide up-to-date information
